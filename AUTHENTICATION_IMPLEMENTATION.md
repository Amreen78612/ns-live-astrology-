# Authentication Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented role-based authentication with NextAuth.js and Drizzle ORM. Users are now redirected based on their role after login, and routes are properly protected.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Redirects After Login**

- ✅ Admin users are redirected to `/dashboard` after successful login
- ✅ Regular users are redirected to `/` (home page) after successful login
- ✅ Session is checked to determine user role

### 2. **Route Protection via Middleware**

- ✅ `/dashboard` route is protected - only authenticated users can access
- ✅ Unauthenticated users trying to access `/dashboard` are redirected to `/login`
- ✅ `/admin` routes remain protected - only admin role users can access
- ✅ Authenticated users trying to access `/login` are redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on role

### 3. **Login Page Updates** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Checks if user is already logged in and redirects accordingly
- ✅ After successful login, fetches session to determine user role
- ✅ Redirects based on role: admin → `/dashboard`, user → `/`
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

### 4. **Middleware Updates** (`src/middleware.ts`)

- ✅ Handles `/login` page - redirects authenticated users away
- ✅ Protects `/dashboard` route - requires authentication
- ✅ Protects `/admin` routes - requires admin role
- ✅ Allows public routes (articles, astrologers, courses, etc.)

## How It Works

### Login Flow:

1. User enters credentials on `/login` page
2. Credentials are validated against database using bcrypt
3. If successful, session is created with user role
4. Session data is fetched to determine role
5. User is redirected:
   - **Admin** → `/dashboard`
   - **Regular user** → `/`

### Middleware Protection:

1. Middleware intercepts requests to protected routes
2. Checks for authentication token
3. Validates user role for admin routes
4. Redirects appropriately based on authentication status and role

### Access Control:

- **Public Routes**: No authentication required (home, articles, astrologers, courses, etc.)
- **Authenticated Routes**: Require login (`/dashboard`)
- **Admin Routes**: Require admin role (`/admin/*`)

## Files Modified

1. **src/middleware.ts**
   - Added `/login` to matcher
   - Added logic to redirect authenticated users from login page
   - Improved dashboard protection
   - Better handling of role-based redirects

2. **src/app/login/page.tsx**
   - Added `useSession` hook to check if already logged in
   - Added `useEffect` to redirect if already authenticated
   - Updated `handleLogin` to fetch session and redirect based on role
   - Improved error handling

## Usage

### Default Test Credentials

After running the database seeds:

**Admin User:**

```
Email: admin@nsliveastro.com
Password: admin123
Redirects to: /dashboard
```

**Regular User:**

```
Email: user@nsliveastro.com
Password: user123
Redirects to: /
```

### Testing the Implementation

1. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter admin credentials
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

2. **Test Regular User Login:**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter regular user credentials
   - Should redirect to `/`

3. **Test Protected Routes:**
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` without logging in
   - Should redirect to `/login`
   - After logging in, can access `/dashboard`

4. **Test Login Redirect:**
   - Log in as any user
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Should automatically redirect based on role

5. **Test Admin Protection:**
   - Log in as regular user
   - Try accessing `/admin`
   - Should redirect to `/` (home page)

## Implementation Details

### Session-Based Authentication

Uses NextAuth.js with JWT strategy. Session includes:

- User ID
- Email
- Name
- Role (admin/user)

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Stored securely in database
- Never transmitted or logged in plain text

### Route Protection Strategy

- **Client-side**: Login page checks session and redirects
- **Server-side**: Middleware protects routes before rendering
- **Double-check**: Both middleware and page components verify auth

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication
- [ ] Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Add role-based UI in dashboard
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Add session timeout handling
- [ ] Add "Remember me" functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users stuck on login page

**Solution**: Check that `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set in `.env.local`

### Issue: Redirect not working

**Solution**: Verify middleware is in `src/` directory (not `src/app/`)

### Issue: Role not detected after login

**Solution**: Check that `session` callback in `src/lib/auth.ts` includes role

### Issue: Can't access dashboard

**Solution**: Ensure database has been seeded and user exists with correct credentials

## Security Notes

✅ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
✅ Sessions use JWT with secure tokens
✅ Middleware protects routes server-side
✅ Role-based access control enforced
✅ CSRF protection (NextAuth built-in)
✅ Environment secrets stored securely
